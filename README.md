## Study of Compression Statistics and Prediction of Rate-Distortion Curves for Video Texture

Encoding textural content remains a challenge for current standardised video codecs. It is therefore beneficial to understand video textures in terms of both their spatio-temporal characteristics and their encoding statistics in order to optimize encoding performance.

This repository provides code organised in folders that implements processes, as described in the paper below. Particularly:
- feature extraction 
- feature selection
- RD model parameters prediction.

The dataset used for this work is HomTex and can be found [here](https://data.bristol.ac.uk/data/dataset/1h2kpxmxdhccf1gbi2pmvga6qp).

Further work on the topic area of video texture can be found [here](https://angkats.github.io/video-texture/).
